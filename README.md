# Discord-Bot
This bot can answer on pings, randomly reply & puts reactions, make chat resume and have memory feature.
This Bot mainly use gemini API but its just for me bcuz I can't afford to buy any.
All you have to make him work its just make his "Personality" prompt, install some pips and make an .env file.
